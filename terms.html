    <h3>terms and conditions</h3>
    <p>Your Terms and Conditions agreement helps you prevent abuses by setting out your right to terminate <br>accounts of people who commit abuses.

        A Terms and Conditions agreement acts as a legally binding contract between you and your users. It's <br>the agreement that sets the rules and guidelines that users must agree to and follow in <br>order to use and access your website or mobile app.
        
        In this agreement, you can include the necessary sections to inform users of the guidelines of using your <br>website or mobile app, what happens if users are abusing your website or mobile app, and so on.
        
        Examples of actions of abusive users can include spamming other users, posting defamatory content or attempting <br>to infect the website or app with malware.
        
        If your website or mobile app hosts content that is generated by users, you can include a clause in the Terms <br>and Conditions to inform users that harmful language won't be tolerated, as well as <br>spamming other users (depending on the function of your website: via public or private messages).
        
        All of these can result in having those users who are found abusing your website temporarily banned.

        Reason #2: Own Your Content
        The #2 reason why you need a Terms and Conditions agreement is to own your content.
        
        Your Terms and Conditions agreement helps you own your content by allowing for clauses to address intellectual<br> property and copyright.
        
        As the website owner, you're the owner of your logo, content (except for user-generated content, as most websites<br> will inform users that any content created by users is theirs),<br> the design of the website, and so on.
        
        In your Terms and Conditions agreement, you can inform users that you are the owner of such content (as mentioned above) <br>and that the content you own is protected by international <br>copyright laws.
        
        This kind of clause is commonly referred as the Intellectual Property clause, and it usually looks like this:
        
        The Site and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by [Owner of Website] and are protected by international <br>copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual <br>property or proprietary rights laws.
        The Terms of Service page of Insider Inc. includes an Intellectual Property clause that clearly explains that the content is owned <br>by the company:

        Reason #3: Terminate Accounts
        The #3 reason why you need a Terms and Conditions agreement is to terminate accounts.
        
        When you include a clause that deals with termination of user accounts, you maintain your right to do this when needed. This clause <br>informs users that abusive accounts will be terminated and banned from using the service.
        
        If Reason #1: Prevent Abuses suggested that you could temporarily ban users, another common clause that Terms and Conditions agreements <br>include is the Termination clause.
        
        The Termination clause is aimed at websites that have a registration section (e.g. user must register before using and/or accessing <br>certain sections of the website), as you can disable or ban the abusive <br>users based on the activity of their accounts.
        
        The Termination clause usually looks like:
        
        We may terminate your access to the Site, without cause or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information<br> associated with your account. All provisions of this Agreement that, by their nature,<br> should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
        Here is how the Terms & Conditions of The Guardian presents this clause:

        Reason #4: Limit Liability
        The #4 reason why you need a Terms and Conditions agreement is to limit your liability.
        
        Terms and Conditions agreements commonly include a warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability clause that try to limit the website <br>owner's liability in cases where errors are found in the content presented on the website,<br> where the service isn't operable at 100 percent of the time, or if a product you sell turns out to be faulty.
        
        This  kind of clause notifies users that the owner can't be held responsible for any errors in the content presented, or for the information <br>provided being accurate, complete, or suitable for any purposes, etc.</p>
